# Welcome

Welcome to my personal website! This space serves as a hub for my projects, thoughts, and technical explorations.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Projects**: A showcase of my technical projects and implementations
- **Workflow**: Insights into my development processes and tools
- **Topics**: Deep dives into various technical subjects:
  - ML/AI: Explorations in machine learning and artificial intelligence
  - Full Stack Development: Web development projects and learnings
- **Journal**: Personal reflections and technical writing

Feel free to explore the different sections using the navigation menu above. Each section is organized to provide clear and structured access to the content.

## Getting Started

The best way to explore this site is to:

1. Browse through the **Projects** section to see my work
2. Check out the **Topics** section for technical deep-dives
3. Visit the **Journal** for my latest thoughts and updates

I hope you find something interesting and useful here!

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
